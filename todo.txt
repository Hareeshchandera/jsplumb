  	- [todo] support gradients in endpoints (dot can support radial, rectangle can support linear)
 	- [todo] support deriving endpoint/connector color from the bg color of the element they are
 	         plumbing.  this is kind of an extension to how the endpoints derive their colour from
 	         the strokeStyle of the connector if their own color is not defined.
 	- [todo] support an endpoint finding it's color from the closest color stop in a connector's
 	         gradient, if the connector has a gradient.
 	- [todo] ? support patterns in connectors and endpoints.
 	- [todo] ? support attaching DOM events so jsPlumb can respond when the size/position/visibility
 	           of some element changes.
