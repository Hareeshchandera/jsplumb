* 1.2.1

	- supports multiple instances of jsPlumb per page ( jsPlumb.newInstance(defaults) )  
	- performance enhancements on connection registration
	- jsPlumb.Defaults.Anchor added to defaults
	- equals method added to Anchor class.
	- fix for issue 8: detach method blows up if no target specified.
	- added 'complete' event to event lists in mootools and jquery
	- animate runs oncomplete event at anim end automatically, to clean up
	- added setDefaultScope and getDefaultScope  
	- moved scope from drag/drop options into Endpoint options
	- todo: add scope to the connect method too.   
	- added getConnections method  
	- added 'container' concept    
	- added 'clearCache' method
	- added 'removeEveryEndpoint' method
	- added 'reset' method

* 1.2

	- adding support for libraries other than jQuery. Starting with MooTools.
	- added 'wrap' function in to jsPlumb public API.
	- added 'extend' function in to jsPlumb public API.

* 1.1.1

	- added jsPlumb.removeAllEndpoints method
	- added isConnectedTo(anEndpoint) method to Endpoint class
	- added Triangle Endpoint type
    - bugfix for removeEndpoint method (it was not removing endpoints...)
    - introduced NaturalDocs for API documentation

* 1.1.0
	  
	- added _jsPlumbContextNode element into which all canvases are drawn.  makes for faster lookup and 
	  easier cleanup.
	  
	- Anchors must now implement 'getOrientation' rather than just having an 'orientation' member.
	  This is used to support anchors whose orientation is calculated dynamically (such as when dragging)
	  
    - internally jsPlumb is now "endpoint-centric" rather than "connection-centric" as it used to be.
      this allows us to add Endpoints that have no connections at creation time, and that can act as
      sources and targets for Connections.
    
	- added setDraggable method to jsPlumb.  overrides what any given plumb command may request.
	- added setDraggableByDefault method.
	- added toggleDraggable method to jsPlumb.
	
	- renamed toggle to toggleVisible (but kept the old one for backwards compatibility)
	
	- added jsPlumb.Endpoints.Blank Endpoint type.
      
    - renamed '_removeCanvas' to '_removeElement' to more properly reflect what it does.
    - added '_removeElements' method.
    
    - introduced jsPlumb.Defaults, which replaces all the old, capitalised, things like
      DEFAULT_ENDPOINTS, DEFAULT_CONNECTOR, etc. so you'd say
      
      jsPlumb.Defaults.DefaultEndpoints
      
      instead of
      
      jsPlumb.DEFAULT_ENDPOINTS
      
    - added support for draggable connectors.
    
    - added animate function.
    
    - added removeEndpoint function
    
    - introduced qunit testing.
    
    - now writes a 'jsPlumb_dragged' class to an element at the end of a drag.
      this can be used to test for a recent drag in a click handler, because drag fires click.
      and you dont always want that.
      

* 1.0.4

	- fix for issue 5 (zIndex error causing 'invalid argument' in IE) :
	
	http://code.google.com/p/jsplumb/issues/detail?id=5&can=1
		
	- added 'setDraggable' method.  this allows you to override whether or not a given element can be dragged,
	  regardless of what any plumb call might request.
	  
	- added setDraggableByDefault method.  Use this to tell jsPlumb whether or not elements should be draggable
	  by default.  jsPlumb assumes they should be if you do nothing.
	  
	- private 'drag' method renamed to '_draw'
	- private 'setVisible' method renamed to '_setVisible'
	- private 'newCanvas' method renamed to '_newCanvas'
	- private 'removeCanvas' method renamed to '_removeCanvas'
	
	  

* 1.0.3

	- fix for issue 2:
	
		http://code.google.com/p/jsplumb/issues/detail?id=2&can=1
		
		jsPlumb threw an error if jquery UI was not included in the page.
		
	- fix for issue 4:
	
		http://code.google.com/p/jsplumb/issues/detail?id=4&can=1
		
		wrong control points for bezier curve when anchor orientations were perpendicular
		to each other.
		

* 1.0.2

	- added fix for dragging in 1.8 (absolutePosition was renamed to 'offset' in the drag object)
	- bugfix for the case that detachAll has been called and the user subsequently tries to drag something.
	- bugfix for hide/show being called with an id for an element that is not plumbed.
	- applyPaintStyle method now returns the object that was extended; can be chained.

* 1.0.1

	- added detachEverything() method : detaches everything. and then cleans up the storage.
	- added repaintEverything() method : refreshes everything.
	- added window resize listener; this is hooked up to the repaint everything method.
	- added unload() method, used to cleanup jsPlumb when the page unloads 


* 1.0.0

  This is 0.0.4-RC5.

 * 0.0.4-RC5

 	- better documentation
 	
 * 0.0.4-RC4 (03/26/10)
 
 	- added Image endpoint type.

 * 0.0.4-RC3 (03/26/10)

 	- added anchors demonstration.
 	
 	- added facility to specify different endpoints and endpoint styles for each end of a connector.
 
 * 0.0.4-RC2 (03/24/10)
 		
 	-	the Connectors and Endpoints are no longer static - they must now be instantiated, for example:
 	
 				new jsPlumb.Connectors.BEZIER();
 			
 	- you can supply a 'curviness' argument to the BEZIER constructor now:
 			
 			new jsPlumb.Connectors.BEZIER(75)
 			
 			it defines the distance in pixels that each control point is situated from the connector.
 	
 	- added support for gradients in Connectors  
 			
 	 
 * 0.0.4-RC1   (3/23/10)
 
   - fixed issue 1: when straight_line connector is used and elements directly underneath/next to
     each other, the connector is not drawn.     
 
 * 0.0.3	(3/15/10)
 
   - initial release  
   		 -- no support for gradients/patterns.  
   		 -- single endpoint style per connector (can't have diff. endpoints at each end)
