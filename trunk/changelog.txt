 
 * 0.0.4-RC2 (03/24/10)
 		
 	-	the Connectors and Endpoints are no longer static - they must now be instantiated, for example:
 	
 				new jsPlumb.Connectors.BEZIER();
 			
 	- you can supply a 'curviness' argument to the BEZIER constructor now:
 			
 			new jsPlumb.Connectors.BEZIER(75)
 			
 			it defines the distance in pixels that each control point is situated from the connector.
 	
 	- added support for gradients in Connectors  
 			
 	 
 * 0.0.4-RC1   (3/23/10)
 
   - fixed issue 1: when straight_line connector is used and elements directly underneath/next to
     each other, the connector is not drawn.     
 
 * 0.0.3	(3/15/10)
 
   - initial release  
   		 -- no support for gradients/patterns.  
   		 -- single endpoint style per connector (can't have diff. endpoints at each end)
